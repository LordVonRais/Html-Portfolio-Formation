    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am currently looking for an employer to complete my work-study program as part of the Web Developer course at OpenClassrooms, under either an apprenticeship or professionalization contract. With a flexible schedule of 3 to 4 days per week in the company and training days as agreed upon with the organization, I am eager to begin this new professional experience.
    Passionate about technology for many years, I have developed my skills by working with various technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C++, C#, Unity, and Blender. My diverse professional background from inventory clerk to IT assistant demonstrates my ability to adapt to different work environments.
    I am determined to deepen my web development skills and make a meaningful contribution to your organization. Thank you for considering my application.
    Sincerely,
    </p>
